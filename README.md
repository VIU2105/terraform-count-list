# terraform-count-list
This repo demonstrates how to use Terraform's count feature with a list to provision multiple Azure resources. The example creates multiple Azure Resource Groups or Storage Accounts by iterating over a list of names. This pattern helps scale resource creation efficiently using clean and reusable Terraform code.
